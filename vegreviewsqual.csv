Wow, what a great restaurant with delicious German cuisine. We had dinner here recently and we all loved it!
The old half-timbered house is really worth seeing. It has its very own atmosphere and a great ambiance.
The menu is relatively small, but all dishes convinced us. My Wiener Schnitzel was really great - just how you want it!
The team there is very young, but extremely nice and attentive.
I heartily recommend this restaurant. We'd love to come back!
Tip: It makes sense to make a reservation at the weekend!

Very nice ambience in a really great old half-timbered house. The food was delicious, upscale German cuisine at a good price-performance ratio. The service was very hard. Gladly again.

We stayed at the Mausefalle on 11/27/22 and we really enjoyed it. Very nice atmosphere, professional and friendly service. Great steaks! Small card and paid about 55 euros per person …",1
