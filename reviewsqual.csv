Wow, what a great restaurant with delicious German cuisine. We had dinner here recently and we all loved it!
The old half-timbered house is really worth seeing. It has its very own atmosphere and a great ambiance.
The menu is relatively small, but all dishes convinced us. My Wiener Schnitzel was really great - just how you want it!
The team there is very young, but extremely nice and attentive.
I heartily recommend this restaurant. We'd love to come back!
Tip: It makes sense to make a reservation at the weekend!

Parking: Ausreichend freie Parkpl√§tze in der Umgebung vorhanden.

We stayed at the Mausefalle on 11/27/22 and we really enjoyed it. Very nice atmosphere, professional and friendly service. Great steaks! Small card and paid about 55 euros per person ‚Ä¶",1

Pleasant restaurant in a cultivated ambience in the middle of the old town. In the extensively renovated half-timbered house, food is served on the ground floor and on the two upper floors; that demands the service staff! The guest rooms were sometimes too loud (music), communication sometimes difficult. The quality of the food was very satisfactory, the service attentive and courteous. We were very satisfied and would love to come back.

Very tasty food right next to the church in pleasant shade.
The cold tomato soup as a ""greeting"" from the kitchen with homemade bread was the best thing I've eaten in a long time.
The wait staff was friendly and attentive - definitely a place to go multiple times.",1

It was just an all-round successful experience. Starting with the very nice greeting, through the consistently attentive and friendly manner of service, to the mastering of smaller challenges by the small children at the next table, the service left such a great impression that I, as a 49-year-old guy, had not been able to experience in a long time. Of course, the quality of the food itself should not be neglected. Such a decent steak in this house is a lot of fun. We would like to come again.

After a long time back on site, in this funny restaurant. If you haven't just looked in the bar (ground floor) it's time to crawl. The staircase leads over several floors to the small rooms, some of which only have one table. Nevertheless, a good 30 people can also be accommodated as a group. Well, I find it funny and quaint.
The food was good as usual. Unfortunately, the menu is very small, but with a kitchen of about 9 square meters it is very understandable. AND: Everyone can find something!

We've always wanted to eat at the Mausefalle. This time it was timely. So table booked. (It is advisable to do this since it is in the evening
every table has been occupied.)
The restaurant is in the old town and is a half-timbered house. Our table was on the first floor and I/we felt right at home, especially since a very friendly waitress welcomed us and took us to our table. As an entr√©e there was homemade bread with very tasty olive oil and sea salt, plus a little greeting from the kitchen - potato soup. Yummy.
I ordered the rump steak with pepper sauce and mayo (homemade). Homemade green herb butter was served with the steak. It went really well with the steak, which by the way was buttery soft.
The salad was dressed with the amazing olive oil and also had pine nuts. I ordered the rhubarb rinha to drink. Non-alcoholic cocktail.
The service was very friendly and courteous and dealt with our requests with ease. That's how I wish it.
All in all, I can only recommend the Mausefalle and we were definitely not there for the last time. Thumbs up! üëç",1

Delicious! Had the most tender and best medium fillet steak of my life there! Prices may be salty - but this extraordinary experience is worth it every time. Also great in terms of atmosphere, location and interior design - very rustic country style over several open floors. Clear recommendation: veal cutlets and fillet steak!",1
"
Very good food, a bit more expensive but it's worth it. I chose the fillet steak and it was the best steak I've ever eaten. Exclusive wines are also on offer. Friendly staff, they really deserve a good tip, if only for the fact that they have to climb all the stairs - hats off!

A really nice rustic ambience and good food. The waiter was very friendly and everything went quickly. The restaurant serves its guests in a relaxed but professional atmosphere. The price is a bit higher but absolutely justified.

The knuckle took a long time, but it was rarely so crisp and juicy.

It's worth a visit!",1

I celebrated my 60th birthday in the Mausefalle with family and friends (20 people). From coffee & cake from 3 p.m. to dinner and well past midnight with curry sausage and a few drinks.

The homemade cakes from the Mausefalle were great, the whiskey cake excellent.. Coffee and a welcome drink, everything was right..

The dinner menu was praised by all guests without exception and was delicious.

The service is always attentive, extremely friendly and helpful.

We can only warmly recommend the location Mausefalle, M√ºlheim an der Ruhr.. great premises.. value for money absolutely fine..

All the best to the whole team, keep it up,,

It was perfect dinner! We came from South Korea for biz trip in Mulehaim here and just googling and find highest rated restaurant near the hotel and found this restaurant. Here is perfect for German traditional dishes like haxe and schnitzel. And more than the dishes I was touched by service from the waitress. She was from Poland and even we were sitting on 2nd floor she was always asking that if we need something and dishes are fine. She told us her name but I forgot her name‚Ä¶Anyway it was great time for us thanks to you and wish everybody who saw this review has to visit this restaurant! Thank you polish friend!,1

Today we wanted to go out for a ""bourgeois"" meal with friends. Our choice is a mousetrap.
We then reserved a table over the Internet - it worked out wonderfully. And it is also necessary! The restaurant was so busy that almost all tables were occupied.
The service is very friendly and accommodating. We opted for the knuckle and it's worth waiting the 45 minutes indicated on the menu. The meat falls off the bone super tender.
The waiting time was bridged with very tasty bread and a greeting from the kitchen. The appetizers were also very tasty.

A really super nice location. Cosy, family atmosphere in a rustic half-timbered house. Just great and somehow not M√ºlheim. Extremely courteous and friendly staff.

Only the fried black pudding with endive mashed potatoes were inedible (according to the person who ordered it). It should also be mentioned that we had two vegan eaters with us and heaven and hell were set in motion to conjure up a very delicious dish for the two of them. Many thanks again for that.....

Beautiful, rustic restaurant with a constantly changing, seasonal menu and a large selection of wines, spirits and other drinks. You should bring some time with you, as the restaurant is reportedly part of the ""Slow Food"" movement. All dishes are completely homemade (including bread, Hollandaise sauce during the asparagus season, etc.) and of a quality that you don't get often anymore (homegrown vegetables, etc.). Taste: Consistently great - we've never had a bad meal here.

The staff has been the same waitresses for years, who all know their trade and are always very friendly and attentive. Of course, when it's full, it can happen that you have to wait a bit (which is partly due to the premises - three winding floors are of course more confusing than one large bar), but that's also complaining on a high level and does not detract from the quality.

We always like to come back here!",1

Very clear menu - already good!

I thought the four beers in advance were great, no Veltins and the like. Nice ambience, nice (not always very professional) service.

"Very nice! The food was excellent and the staff was very polite. I liked the ambience a lot, feels like a bit of living history of the city.",1
"
The ambience is great, rustic restaurant over 3 floors. The service staff is friendly, attentive and fast. So much for the drinks... I had a ""Hokkaido pumpkin cream soup with sour cream and grainy puff pastry stick"" first. The taste is very appealing, but I've never had such a thin cream soup. More like a broth. For the main course I had ""handmade tagliatelle with fried mixed mushrooms in creamy sauce"". Taste was consistent, but not a highlight for me. The noodles were a bit too firm for me, but that's also a matter of taste.
The topic ""Slow Food"" is implemented very well here, we waited almost 2 hours for the main course. It should also be mentioned that we were there with a larger group and had communicated our food selection in advance by email. I can't judge how long it takes with a ""normal"" order on site, with less food that has to be served at the same time. Up to this point it would certainly have been 4 stars... solid to good food (the greeting from the kitchen was my highlight of the evening), great ambience and really good service staff (unfortunately you don't experience that often anymore).
However, I have to deduct the star, because in my opinion the price is absolutely exaggerated for the portions. The pasta portion would at most be worthy of an appetizer. I turned up 8 forks of pasta until there were only a few mushrooms left in the bowl. Maybe you could get 10 with a little less noodles per fork, but for 18‚Ç¨ it's cheeky. I would have found double the amount to be reasonable (and then would have been full). Even the ladies from the group with the same dish were not full.
There was similar feedback from colleagues who had a Wiener Schnitzel.

Conclusion: Everything was great, but you shouldn't be too hungry and be aware of the prices. The quality is certainly good, but you can find that in other restaurants with slightly more moderate prices.",1

Menu was laid on the table, not a word too many; We requested drinks after 25 minutes, until then no contact from the service. Ordered starter and main course, starter came after 30 minutes, main course after an hour... The food is ok, but not above average, value for money also ok. A unique visit for us. Therefore we cannot understand the number of very good reviews. Visit on 05/29/2020, dinner.",0

Delicious food and very friendly staff. Very picturesque place in a historical building. Reservations are a real advantage here because the restaurant is very busy. But no wonder, the price / performance ratio is right.",1
"
The fries were way too greasy, the ""sweet and spicy"" curry sauce way too hot! And the waiting time (45min) for chips, currywurst, pasta and ciesh is far too long! Therefore 1 star.

Poor performance!",0
"
Excellent, regional (and seasonal!) cuisine with a very manageable menu. The selection of wines is good and suits the reduced offer of the house. Consistently good quality of the food with corresponding waiting time. The price-performance ratio is excellent. Only the very meat-heavy selection no longer quite meets the requirements (only one pasta dish as a vegetarian alternative). The presentation of the food is not careless, but very simple. There is still room for improvement here. The (excellent) cheese platter could e.g. B. be served on slate or similar, instead of on a simple plate.

The location itself is rustic/cozy within historic walls. Here you feel comfortable and welcome as a guest.

Small negligence in the service does not quite match the top kitchen. First served by a young lady, the staff changed (a total of 3 contacts). It's not drama - but it's not positive either. A little tip for the boss: If the kitchen is visible, the service staff shouldn't stand and eat there, but rather devote themselves to the guests. ;-)

Unfortunately, the sanitary facilities have to be rated negatively - they simply don't suit the house at all. Everything looks run-down, from the 70s in terrible colors - even a little decoration can't save anything anymore. A pub feeling spreads here.",1

A top recommendation for spoiled gourmets.
Here the ambience is rustic with delicious selected beers such as M√∂lmsch and F√ºchschen.

Definitely in the category ""the BEST I've ever eaten!""
Everything is fresh and from local farmers, Wiener schnitzel from the milk calf with an incredibly good side salad and homemade fries with mayo, there was homemade bread and a cucumber soup from the kitchen and really great mega creamy ice cream! Priced in the upper level but worth every euro for the quality! We were served very politely and quickly!",1

One of the best German restaurants I've ever been to!
Pumpkin soup and cheese excellent, as well as dessert. The waiters were very nice.",1

For almost burnt fries, a small currywurst (80g) 11 euros and that as a starter is already expensive. Even if it tasted good.",1
"
The food was excellent. Before we got bread and a little soup from the house to bridge the time. The apple juice tasted superb, had nothing to do with the usual drink you get elsewhere.
Didn't feel like I waited too long for my food like some here. But it takes a certain waiting time if I get freshly prepared food in return. The portion was more than satisfactory for me, unfortunately there was no room for dessert. There is an incredible drinks menu, especially the beer selection is huge. It's not cheap, of course, but it's really worth it!
Not to forget: the incredibly friendly service!",0

Excellent cuisine under the current management, and with the pub area downstairs there is something for everyone, even if you are traveling with several people and maybe not everyone wants to eat. In the beginning, I understood the statement sometimes found here that the service was too slow -- but now the team makes a pretty well integrated impression and I really can't complain about the lack of speed. A pleasant, well-run place where you can go for a nightcap beer as well as a really nice meal.",0

Great restaurant, great outdoor area. The food is freshly prepared, many ingredients come from our own garden or from the chef's field. There is still proper training here. The food is great, the waitresses do a great job. Priced mid-range. We recommend.",1

Very tasty food, from the starter to the dessert, everything was right, as was the friendly service. One of the best restaurants in Mulheim.",1
"
Beautiful, rustic restaurant with a constantly changing, seasonal menu and a large selection of wines, spirits and other drinks. You should bring some time with you, as the restaurant is reportedly part of the ""Slow Food"" movement. All dishes are completely homemade (including bread, Hollandaise sauce during the asparagus season, etc.) and of a quality that you don't get often anymore (homegrown vegetables, etc.). Taste: Consistently great - we've never had a bad meal here.

The staff has been the same waitresses for years, who all know their trade and are always very friendly and attentive. Of course, when it's full, it can happen that you have to wait a bit (which is partly due to the premises - three winding floors are of course more confusing than one large bar), but that's also complaining on a high level and does not detract from the quality.

We always like to come back here!",1

A beautiful restaurant in the heart of M√ºlheim. The staff is super friendly and accommodating. The food is lovingly prepared and tastes great. The prices are in a high but reasonable level. Parking spaces are of course rare in the city center with a resident parking permit.",1
"
Very clear menu - already good!

I thought the four beers in advance were great, no Veltins and the like. Nice ambience, nice (not always very professional) service.

I found the pricing reasonable. A Wiener schnitzel for 23 EUR is quite cheap, cr√®me brulee for 5.50 completely OK - with a soup you are there with 11. The latter was also very good, but quite expensive.",1
" Very nice place and nice waitresses. Very slow service. At least two hours to have dinner. Portions decidedly not very abundant and we do not recommend fish. Approximately ‚Ç¨30 per person. When you enter, there is a strong smell from the toilet on the ground floor which is also used by passers-by who do not eat in the restaurant.

The ambience is great, rustic restaurant over 3 floors. The service staff is friendly, attentive and fast. So much for the drinks... I had a ""Hokkaido pumpkin cream soup with sour cream and grainy puff pastry stick"" first. The taste is very appealing, but I've never had such a thin cream soup. More like a broth. For the main course I had ""handmade tagliatelle with fried mixed mushrooms in creamy sauce"". Taste was consistent, but not a highlight for me. The noodles were a bit too firm for me, but that's also a matter of taste.
The topic ""Slow Food"" is implemented very well here, we waited almost 2 hours for the main course. It should also be mentioned that we were there with a larger group and had communicated our food selection in advance by email. I can't judge how long it takes with a ""normal"" order on site, with less food that has to be served at the same time. Up to this point it would certainly have been 4 stars... solid to good food (the greeting from the kitchen was my highlight of the evening), great ambience and really good service staff (unfortunately you don't experience that often anymore).
However, I have to deduct the star, because in my opinion the price is absolutely exaggerated for the portions. The pasta portion would at most be worthy of an appetizer. I turned up 8 forks of pasta until there were only a few mushrooms left in the bowl. Maybe you could get 10 with a little less noodles per fork, but for 18‚Ç¨ it's cheeky. I would have found double the amount to be reasonable (and then would have been full). Even the ladies from the group with the same dish were not full.
There was similar feedback from colleagues who had a Wiener Schnitzel.

Conclusion: Everything was great, but you shouldn't be too hungry and be aware of the prices. The quality is certainly good, but you can find that in other restaurants with slightly more moderate prices.",1
"
The restaurant has recently been under new management and has had a real makeover. The menu is still quite manageable but, as the chef/owner has assured it, will be gradually expanded, after all it only started recently. It's now super clean again and I'm just fascinated by this crooked half-timbered architecture.
I had a steak to eat, which is definitely in the top class in terms of taste. I'm already looking forward to my next visit.",1

The ""Mausefall"" restaurant in M√ºlheim gets a full five stars from me. The ambience is great - the Mausefalle can be found in the middle of M√ºlheim's old town in a cute half-timbered house, where you can eat and celebrate on a total of five floors. On the ground floor you can chat over a beer, on all other floors you can enjoy excellent food. The menu is always quite small, but very fresh and changes more often.

The restaurant is only not ideal for the handicapped; However, due to the old building, I don't think access for disabled people can be implemented, so no deduction.",1

New owner - big disappointment. The staff was nice. The location itself is nice, but it always was.

prices def. too expensive. Portions clear. mixed taste. The shank was good. Heaven & √Ñd horrible. The apple strudel was the size of a Mars bar and cost ‚Ç¨7.50. Unfortunately, it was only semi-delicious.
